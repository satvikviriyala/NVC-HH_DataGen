TASK: Annotate HH-RLHF harmless-base preference pairs into OFNR schema.

Target Output File: Gemini3_pro_harmless_base_train.jsonl
Input File: hh-rlhf/harmless-base/train.jsonl

Context:
You are processing the input file `hh-rlhf/harmless-base/train.jsonl`.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - ITERATION LOOP:
You must NOT stop after processing one row. You must output a valid JSONL object for EVERY row in the input file.

Output Handling & Resumability:
1. Check if the file `Gemini3_pro_harmless_base_train.jsonl` exists.
2. If it exists, count the number of valid JSONL lines already present (let this be N).
3. SKIP the first N rows of the input file `hh-rlhf/harmless-base/train.jsonl`.
4. Start processing from row N+1.
5. PROCESS ALL REMAINING ROWS SEQUENTIALLY.
   - Read Row N+1 -> Generate JSON -> Append to Output File.
   - Read Row N+2 -> Generate JSON -> Append to Output File.
   - ... Repeat until End of File.
6. Do NOT stop until all lines in the input file are processed.

Input format (one line):
{
  "chosen": "Human: ...\nAssistant: ...",
  "rejected": "Human: ...\nAssistant: ..."
}

GOAL:
Produce strictly valid JSONL.
Each output line must conform to `ontologies/schema_ofnr.json`.
Append this line to: `Gemini3_pro_harmless_base_train.jsonl`

What to focus on:
- Harmlessness: safety alignment, de-escalation, refusal quality
- Translate pseudo-feelings into verified feelings
- Ensure observation is nonjudgmental (camera-test)
- Extract needs + actionable requests

How to fill schema:
- dataset.teacher_model = "gemini_3_pro"
- source.corpus = "hh-rlhf"
- source.folder = "harmless-base"
- source.split = "train" (or "test" if applicable)
- source.file = "train.jsonl"
- source.pair_type = "chosen_rejected"

input.format = "pair"
input.chosen = provided chosen string
input.rejected = provided rejected string
input.prompt = ONLY the last user turn extracted from the conversation

Safety:
- Always compute safety label
- If content contains self-harm, violence, wrongdoing → disallowed with safe_redirect/refusal

Output format example:
{"id": "...", "ofnr": {...}}

REMEMBER: Output must be JSONL. Iterate through ALL rows.
