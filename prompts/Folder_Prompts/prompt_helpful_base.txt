TASK: Annotate HH-RLHF helpful-base preference pairs into OFNR schema.

You are given one JSONL row from:
hh-rlhf/helpful-base/train.jsonl (or test.jsonl)

Input format:
{
  "chosen": "Human: ...\nAssistant: ...",
  "rejected": "Human: ...\nAssistant: ..."
}

GOAL:
Create ONE JSON object conforming to ontologies/schema_ofnr.json.

What to focus on:
- Helpfulness quality: clarity, completeness, non-evasive support
- Extract the user's underlying needs even if the user requests strategies
- Implicit request must be actionable and constructive
- Keep sentiment preserved (especially if user is upset)

How to fill schema:
- dataset.teacher_model = "gemini_3_pro"
- source.folder = "helpful-base"
- source.pair_type = "chosen_rejected"
- input.format = "pair"
- input.chosen/rejected = provided

Pairwise:
- pairwise_preference.available = true
- Leave preference_alignment fields null unless obvious

Safety:
- Usually allowed, but still detect disallowed content

Output:
Return ONLY ONE valid JSON object. No markdown.

Hard constraints:
- OFNR schema must match exactly
- Need list must match needs ontology (no strategies)
- Requests must score high actionability unless refusal
