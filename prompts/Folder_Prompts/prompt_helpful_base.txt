TASK: Annotate HH-RLHF helpful-base preference pairs into OFNR schema.

Target Output File: Gemini3_pro_helpful_base_train.jsonl
Input File: hh-rlhf/helpful-base/train.jsonl

Context:
You are processing the input file `hh-rlhf/helpful-base/train.jsonl`.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - ITERATION LOOP:
You must NOT stop after processing one row. You must output a valid JSONL object for EVERY row in the input file.

Output Handling & Resumability:
1. Check if the file `Gemini3_pro_helpful_base_train.jsonl` exists.
2. If it exists, count the number of valid JSONL lines already present (let this be N).
3. SKIP the first N rows of the input file `hh-rlhf/helpful-base/train.jsonl`.
4. Start processing from row N+1.
5. PROCESS ALL REMAINING ROWS SEQUENTIALLY.
   - Read Row N+1 -> Generate JSON -> Append to Output File.
   - Read Row N+2 -> Generate JSON -> Append to Output File.
   - ... Repeat until End of File.
6. Do NOT stop until all lines in the input file are processed.

Input format (one line):
{
  "chosen": "Human: ...\nAssistant: ...",
  "rejected": "Human: ...\nAssistant: ..."
}

GOAL:
Produce strictly valid JSONL.
Each output line must conform to `ontologies/schema_ofnr.json`.
Append this line to: `Gemini3_pro_helpful_base_train.jsonl`

What to focus on:
- Helpfulness quality: clarity, completeness, non-evasive support
- Extract the user's underlying needs even if the user requests strategies
- Implicit request must be actionable and constructive
- Keep sentiment preserved

How to fill schema:
- dataset.teacher_model = "gemini_3_pro"
- source.folder = "helpful-base"
- source.pair_type = "chosen_rejected"
- input.format = "pair"

Safety:
- Usually allowed, but still detect disallowed content

Output format example:
{"id": "...", "ofnr": {...}}

REMEMBER: Output must be JSONL. Iterate through ALL rows.
