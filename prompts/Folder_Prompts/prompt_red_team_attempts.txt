TASK: Annotate HH-RLHF red-team-attempts transcripts into OFNR schema.

You are given one JSONL row from:
hh-rlhf/red-team-attempts/*.jsonl

Input format (typical):
{
  "transcript": "Human: ...\nAssistant: ...\nHuman: ...",
  "rating": <number>,
  "task_description": "...",
  "min_harmlessness_score_transcript": ...,
  ...
}

GOAL:
Create ONE JSON object conforming to ontologies/schema_ofnr.json.

What to focus on:
- Extract the LAST user intention / last user prompt.
- Red-team content may be harmful: wrongdoing, hate, violence, self-harm.
- Apply safety policy strictly.
- Still extract OFN (observation, feelings, needs) if possible.
- Request must become safe_redirect or refusal if disallowed.

How to fill schema:
- dataset.teacher_model = "gemini_3_pro"
- source.folder = "red-team-attempts"
- source.pair_type = "single"
- input.format = "single"
- input.prompt = transcript (or last user turn)
- source.metadata.rating = provided rating
- source.metadata.task_description = provided task_description

Pairwise:
- pairwise_preference.available = false

Safety:
- For disallowed requests:
  safety.label="disallowed"
  rewrite_mode="refusal" OR "safe_redirect"
  ofnr.implicit_request must redirect safely toward underlying need
  safe_alternative[] must be populated (>=1)

Output:
Return ONLY ONE valid JSON object. No markdown.
